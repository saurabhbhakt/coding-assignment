1. Lambda Expressions: Lambda expressions allow you to pass functionality as arguments to methods or store them in variables. They provide a clear and concise way to represent one method interface (functional interface).
2. Functional Interfaces: A functional interface is an interface with exactly one abstract method. Lambda expressions can be used to implement functional interfaces.
3. Streams API: The Streams API allows you to process sequences of elements (such as collections) in a functional style. Streams can be used to perform operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing.
4. Default Methods in Interfaces: Java 8 allows methods in interfaces to have a default implementation. This helps to add new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.
5. Method References: Method references are a shorthand notation of a lambda expression to call a method.
6. Optional Class: The Optional class is used to represent a value that may or may not be present. It helps avoid NullPointerException and improves readability.
7. New Date and Time API: Java 8 introduced a new Date and Time API (java.time package), which is more flexible and easier to use than the old java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar.
8. Nashorn JavaScript Engine: Java 8 introduced the Nashorn JavaScript engine, which allows you to execute JavaScript code from Java applications.
9. New Collector API (Collectors): Java 8 introduced the Collectors utility class, which provides many convenient methods to collect elements from streams into various collections or summaries.
10. Parallel Streams: Java 8 allows you to process streams in parallel, which can take advantage of multi-core processors.
11. Base64 Encoding and Decoding: Java 8 introduced a new Base64 class to handle encoding and decoding of Base64 content.

### Summary of Java 8 Features:
1. Lambda Expressions: Shorter way to write anonymous methods. 
2. Functional Interfaces: Interfaces with a single abstract method. 
3. Streams API: For processing sequences of elements in a functional way. 
4. Default Methods in Interfaces: To provide method implementations in interfaces. 
5. Method References: Shortened form of lambda expressions. 
6. Optional Class: To avoid null and handle missing values. 
7. New Date and Time API: A better API for handling date and time. 
8. Nashorn JavaScript Engine: Running JavaScript code within Java. 
9. Collectors: Utility class for collecting stream results. 
10. Parallel Streams: To perform parallel computation on streams.
11. Base64 Encoding/Decoding: For handling base64 data.
