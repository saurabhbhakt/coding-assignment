# Microservices Architecture for Bill-Generation System

## 1. Bill Calculation Service

### Responsibilities:

- **Business Logic:**
    - The Bill Service is responsible for the business logic of bill generation, including calculations, validation, and
      data processing.
    - It ensures that client billing information is accurate based on predefined rules (e.g., billing cycles, usage
      data, discounts).

- **Data Validation:**
    - Ensures the data (client details, usage) passed from other services are valid and complete.

- **Database Interaction:**
    - The service interacts with the database to fetch client data, validate usage, and store the generated bill.

### Communication:

- **Client Management Service:** Bill Service communicates with the Client Management Service to fetch client-specific
  data (e.g., usage, preferences).
- **Payment Service:** It may also interact with the Payment Service for bill payment status updates.

## 2. Queueing System (Kafka)

### Responsibilities:

- **Event-driven Communication:**
    - Kafka or RabbitMQ is used to send asynchronous messages between services.
    - It enables event-driven architecture, where services can react to certain events (e.g., Bill Generated, Payment
      Processed, etc.).

### Usage in the System:

- **Notify the Notification Service:**
    - After the Bill Service generates a new bill, it will publish an event (e.g., "BillGenerated") to Kafka.
    - The Notification Service listens for this event to send out notifications like emails, SMS, or push notifications
      to the client.

- **Asynchronous Updates:**
    - Other services, such as the Payment Service or any future services (like Analytics), may also subscribe to Kafka
      events to keep their systems in sync.

## 3. Bill Generation

### Responsibilities:

- **Generate Bill:**
    - This service focuses on calculating the client's bill based on their usage, applicable taxes, discounts, and other
      business rules.

- **Data Interaction:**
    - It validates incoming data (e.g., client usage, billing cycle) to ensure itâ€™s correct and complete.
    - Interacts with the **Database** to retrieve client-specific usage data and store the generated bill information.

- **Business Rules Implementation:**
    - The Bill Generation service implements the business logic for bill calculation, considering variables like
      tariffs, discounts, usage over a period, etc.

- **Trigger Event for Notification:**
    - Once the bill is generated, this service sends an event (e.g., "BillGenerated") to Kafka to notify other systems
      like the Notification Service.

## 4. Notification Service

### Responsibilities:

- **Send Notifications:**
    - The Notification Service is responsible for delivering notifications (email, SMS, push) to clients when certain
      events occur, such as a bill being generated or payment being processed.

- **Communication:**
    - The service listens for events from Kafka (e.g., "BillGenerated", "PaymentReceived") and sends notifications to
      clients as per their preferences.

- **Notification Channels:**
    - It supports various communication channels, including:
        - **Email:** Sending email notifications with the bill details.
        - **SMS:** Sending SMS alerts when a bill is generated or payment is received.
        - **Push Notifications:** Sending notifications through the mobile app (if applicable).

### Data Flow:

- After receiving an event from Kafka (e.g., "BillGenerated"), the Notification Service fetches the necessary bill
  information from the **Bill Service** and sends the appropriate notification to the client.

## 5. Database (e.g., H2 Database)

### Responsibilities:

- **Store Client Data:**
    - The database stores structured data, such as client details, billing information, usage history, and payment
      status.

- **Relational Storage:**
    - Typically, a relational database like **H2**, **MySQL**, or **PostgreSQL** is used to store this data in tables
      like:
        - **Client Table:** Contains client information such as name, email, contact details.
        - **Usage Table:** Contains details of client usage (e.g., number of units used, duration).
        - **Bill Table:** Stores information about the bills generated for each client.
        - **Payment Table:** Stores payment transaction details and statuses.

### Data Interactions:

- **Bill Service & Bill Generation:**
    - Interacts with the database to fetch client data and usage information, and then stores the generated bill.

- **Persistent Storage:**
    - Ensures that all billing, client, and usage data is safely stored and can be retrieved for future processing or
      reporting.

### Database Type:

- **H2 Database:**
    - H2 is a lightweight, in-memory database, ideal for development and testing environments.
    - For production environments, consider using more robust options like MySQL or PostgreSQL for scalability and
      reliability.

## Data Flow and Integration Overview:

1. **Bill Generation:**
    - The **Bill Service** interacts with the **Database** to retrieve client usage data and generate the bill.

2. **Event Publication:**
    - Once the bill is generated, the **Bill Service** publishes an event to **Kafka** (e.g., "BillGenerated").

3. **Notification Service:**
    - The **Notification Service** listens for the "BillGenerated" event from **Kafka**, fetches the bill data, and
      sends notifications (email, SMS, etc.) to the client.

4. **Database Interaction:**
    - All services, especially the Bill Service and Bill Generation, read and write data from the **Database** to manage
      client data, billing information, and payment details.

## Conclusion

This microservice architecture is designed to handle bill generation, notifications, and data management efficiently. By
using **Kafka** for event-driven communication, the system ensures scalability, loose coupling, and asynchronous
processing. Each service is responsible for a specific function, allowing for clear boundaries and easy maintainability.
